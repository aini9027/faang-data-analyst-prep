## 📘 SQL & Pandas Practice Log - Entry 002: Self Join for Employee-Manager Comparison

### 🗓️ Date: 2025-07-21  
### 🎯 Problem: [LeetCode SQL #181 - Employees Earning More Than Their Managers](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/)  
### 🔍 Topic: Self Join + Filtering

---

### ✅ Objective:
Return names of employees who earn more than their managers.

---

### 🧠 SQL Concepts Learned:
- **Self Join**: Joining a table with itself to compare two roles (employee vs manager)
- Use `e.managerId = m.id` to match employee with their manager
- Filter: `WHERE e.salary > m.salary`

---

### 🧪 SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    e.name AS Employee
FROM 
    Employee e
JOIN 
    Employee m 
ON 
    e.managerId = m.id
WHERE 
    e.salary > m.salary;

## 📘 SQL Practice Log - Entry 003: Customers Who Never Order

### 🗓️ Date: 2025-07-23  
### 🎯 Problem: [LeetCode SQL #183 - Customers Who Never Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/)  
### 🔍 Topic: LEFT JOIN, Aliases, NULL Handling

---

### **Objective**
Find all customers who never placed an order.

---

### **Understanding the Data**
**Customers Table**
- `id`: unique customer ID
- `name`: name of the customer

**Orders Table**
- `id`: unique order ID
- `customerId`: references `Customers.id` to show who placed the order

We need to find customers present in `Customers` but not in `Orders`.
