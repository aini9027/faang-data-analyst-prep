Day 1 SQL

-- Create Table
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  city TEXT
);

-- Insert Records
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, age, city) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 30, 'New York'),
(2, 'Bob', 22, 'Los Angeles'),
(3, 'Charlie', 35, 'Chicago'),
(4, 'Diana', 28, 'New York'),
(5, 'Ethan', 42, 'Seattle');


-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Select specific column
SELECT name, city FROM customers;

-- Filter by city
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';

-- Filter by age
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 30;

-- Order by age (descending)
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY age DESC;

-- Limit to top 2
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 2;

-- Use alias
SELECT name AS customer_name, age FROM customers;


-- Day 2

-- Customers older than 25 AND living in New York
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 25 AND city = 'New York';

## 📘 SQL & Pandas Practice Log - Entry 002: Self Join for Employee-Manager Comparison

### 🗓️ Date: 2025-07-21  
### 🎯 Problem: [LeetCode SQL #181 - Employees Earning More Than Their Managers](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/)  
### 🔍 Topic: Self Join + Filtering

---

### ✅ Objective:
Return names of employees who earn more than their managers.

---

### 🧠 SQL Concepts Learned:
- **Self Join**: Joining a table with itself to compare two roles (employee vs manager)
- Use `e.managerId = m.id` to match employee with their manager
- Filter: `WHERE e.salary > m.salary`

---

### 🧪 SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    e.name AS Employee
FROM 
    Employee e
JOIN 
    Employee m 
ON 
    e.managerId = m.id
WHERE 
    e.salary > m.salary;

## 📘 SQL Practice Log - Entry 003: Customers Who Never Order

### 🗓️ Date: 2025-07-23  
### 🎯 Problem: [LeetCode SQL #183 - Customers Who Never Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/)  
### 🔍 Topic: LEFT JOIN, Aliases, NULL Handling

---

### **Objective**
Find all customers who never placed an order.

---

### **Understanding the Data**
**Customers Table**
- `id`: unique customer ID
- `name`: name of the customer

**Orders Table**
- `id`: unique order ID
- `customerId`: references `Customers.id` to show who placed the order

We need to find customers present in `Customers` but not in `Orders`.


  Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
Select name as Customers
from Customers 
where id NOT  IN (select customerId from Orders);
  
### **Key SQL Concepts Learned**
- **LEFT**
 

Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.


  SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
