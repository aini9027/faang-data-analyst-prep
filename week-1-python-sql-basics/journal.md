## 🗓️ Day 1 – Python & SQL Basics

### ✅ What I Learned

#### Python:
- How to write and run basic Python code in Google Colab
- Variables: string, integer, float, boolean
- Basic `if-else` statements and how they control logic
- Loops: `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions

#### SQL:
- Basics of SQL syntax: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Filtering data using numeric and text conditions
- How to create a sample `customers` table for practice

### 🤔 What I Found Confusing
- Remembering when to use single quotes around strings in SQL
- Slight confusion between `=` and `==` in Python vs SQL

---

### 📌 To Revisit
- String formatting in Python (`f-strings` vs `.format()`)
- `LIMIT` behavior when combined with `ORDER BY`
- Keyboard shortcuts and markdown formatting in Colab and GitHub

---

### 🔗 Resources Used
- Google Colab for Python notebooks
- SQLiteOnline.com for SQL query testing
- GitHub for version control and documentation
- ChatGPT for guidance and explanations

### 💬 Notes to Myself
- I feel confident with the basics so far.
- Tomorrow I want to get more comfortable with lists and dictionaries.
- Good start! Let’s build momentum.
